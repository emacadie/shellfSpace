<p><i><a id="What_is_Shellf_Space">What is Shellf Space?</a></i></p>
<p>This is a site devoted to promoting Linux, BSD and other UNIX-based operating 
systems for desktop use and in e-commerce. It uses a database to track
user-supplied entries about which sites will allow a user to complete a
transaction using an open source and/or UNIX-based operating system (such as Linux, FreeBSD,
NetBSD, OpenBSD, or Mac OS X) and any of the browsers that run on
these systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
If you're doing something on the web that involves 1. logging in/registering
and 2. money (either giving some up or checking a balance) and you don't want to
use Windows to do it, then add it to the Shellf Space database. And if you try to
buy something at a web site and cannot complete the transaction, add that too.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, just like people contribute entries to <a
href="http://www.linux-laptop.net">Linux on Laptops</a> about their experience
trying to get Linux to work on a particular laptop, you can contribute entries
to Shellf Space about trying to perform web transactions on a UNIX-based system.
</p>

<br />

<p><i><a id="What_could_cause_a_transaction_to_be_unsuccessful">
What could cause a transaction to be unsuccessful?</a></i></p>

<p>Some sites may have JavaScript that only works on IE, or only on Windows. I
tried to do my taxes online at two different sites with Mozilla on a Linux
machine, and on both sites I couldn't get past a certain point because I
couldn't find the button to go to the next page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some sites may require a Passport/.NET My Services account. These may only
work on Windows machines. There are a few efforts to get Passport working on
UNIX-based systems, but some people will still refuse to use them. Some will
refuse because
they do not want to endorse Microsoft technology, some because they don't want
all their information in one place, some for both reasons. 
</p>

<br />

<p><i><a id="What_inspired_Shellf_Space">What inspired Shellf Space?</a></i></p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, there have been some developments that have led people in
the free software/open source community to believe that the days of using Linux
and other open source OSes to engage in e-commerce may be coming to an end.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people fear that Microsoft's dot NET (including Passport, Hailstorm, and
other technologies) is an attempt to make the Internet into their tollbooth, and
prevent other OSes and browsers from being used. One way this could happen is by
convincing web sites to require users to have a Passport account to use a site.
Given that many sites are already designed to only work with IE, many sites may
go along with whatever Microsoft plans for them. (For stories about sites that
only work with IE, look 
<a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-10-21-014-26-NW-DT-SW">here</a> and 
<a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-10-24-014-26-NW-CY-DT">here</a>.)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have also been a few bills introduced into the United States Congress
which would require copy protection technology to be a part of all electronic
devices, including PCs. Since copy protection could potentially be circumvented,
this would make open source operating systems illegal.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, there are no sites that track which sites will and will not
work with a non-Windows/IE machine. Since I thought there should be one, I
decided to create one. Yay me!
</p>

<br />

<p><i><a id="How_does_this_site_approach">
How does this site approach Linux/BSD desktop advocacy differently than other
desktop advocacy sites?</a></i>
</p>

<p>Generally, when people ask if Linux or BSD is ready for the desktop, they are
looking at whether or not these systems are easy to install, and whether or not
common and useful applications (such as word processing, spreadsheets and image
manipulation applications) exist for these various operating systems.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While these are important considerations, they don't address the question of
using a UNIX-based system for web transactions. The amount of commerce handled on the web
has grown substantially over the past few years, and will continue to do so. As
stated above, Microsoft wants to have as much business done on the web on
systems using only their software (both operating system and browser). They want
to control not only the server
side, but the client side as well, through dot NET and DRM (digital rights
management). Many software and hardware companies will go
along out of fear or laziness. You have probably seen many sites with notices
saying they work best (or only) with IE.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about it like this: what good is a desktop system if you can use it for
word processoring or creating spreadsheets, but can't check
your bank balance, pay your bills, buy something, or participate in a web forum
or message board?
</p>

<br />

<p><i><a id="Why_does_this_site_spell">
Why does this site spell "shellf" with 2 L's?</a></i></p>
<p>Spelling it with 2 L's is a little joke. Although UNIX-based systems can be accessed
 through a GUI, it is also common to access them via a command-line interface.
The commands are interpreted by a program called a shell. Since this site is
promoting UNIX-based systems, I thought "Shellf Space" would be a good name.
</p>

<br />

<p><i><a id="UNIX-based_system">What do you mean by "UNIX-based system"?</a></i></p>
<p>UNIX is a term used to refer to a family of operating systems based on the
original UNIX, which was developed at AT&amp;T Labs in the late 60s. It was used as the basis
for Sun's Solaris, HP's HP-UX, IBM's AIX and SGI's IRIX. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD derived from AT&amp;T's UNIX, although they now
contain no AT&amp;T code. They are based on the Berkeley Software Distribution
written by University of California-Berkeley's Computing Science Research Group,
which evolved into a complete re-write of AT&amp;T UNIX.
(There were commercial UNIX systems based on the BSD code, and some, such as
Solaris and AIX, are a combination of AT&amp;T and BSD.)
Linux is a clone of UNIX, and Apple's OS X is based on
FreeBSD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> For legal reasons, the companies and individuals who produce some of
these operating 
systems cannot call them "UNIX". However, they are allowed to use the terms "UNIX-like"
or "UNIX-based". I just figured typing "UNIX-based system" to refer to PCs
running these operating systems would be concise. Check the <a
href="links.html">links</a> page for more about UNIX.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term "UNIX" is a trademark of <a href="http://www.unix.org">The Open
Group</a>. A good page about The Open Group's relationship to the UNIX standard
and UNIX implementation can be found <a
href="http://www.unix.org/backgrounder.html">here</a>.</p>

<br />

<p><i><a id="NullPointerException">
I'm getting some NullPointerException errors. What's the problem?</a></i></p>

<p>That seems to happen in a couple of cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> One is if you try to use the site without cookies enabled. The
application server used to power this site, Tomcat, uses cookies to track your
session. Please enable them to use this site and make the world safe for
UNIX-based systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another cause is if you try to add a site or update your profile without
actually logging in. I have gotten the errors a few times myself, and going to
the <a href="/servlet/net.shellfspace.members.LoginForm">Login</a> page usually
takes care of it. And yes, I am working on it.</p>

<br />

<p><i><a id="HP-UX_Solaris_IRIX">
Why do you list HP-UX, Solaris and IRIX in your OS options?
</a></i></p>
<p>Just in case somebody actually uses these, which I know is pretty unlikely. I
have heard you can get good deals on UNIX workstations on eBay, so it might
happen.
</p>
<br />

<p><i><a id="Whats_the_big_deal">
So what's the big deal if we all have to use Windows to access the
Internet?</a></i></p>
<p>
Because what is to stop Microsoft from raising the fees if there are no
alternatives? There are alternatives, and they have 
<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-962470.html">increased</a> their
licensing fees.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Besides, isn't this a capitalist, democratic society? Shouldn't I be able to use
whichever OS and browser <b>I</b> want to check my bank account, pay my bills, 
check my email, buy stuff, etc. etc.? Is it really a good idea for ONE company
to be in control of information technology?
</p>

<br />

<p><i><a id="Looks_Bad_In_Sucky_IE">
I tried viwewing your site in Microsoft Internet Explorer, and it doesn't look right. 
Can you fix it so that it looks good in IE?</a></i></p>

<p>Ha!! It's not so much fun when the shoe is on the other foot, now is it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>No I will not &quot;fix&quot; it so it works in IE. This may be the only case 
where &quot;It's not a bug, it's a feature&quot; is actually true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bow down and worship me, puny mortals.</p>

<br />

<p><i><a id="Any_plans_for_this_site_for_the_future">
Any plans for this site for the future? It's pretty spartan.</a></i></p>

<p>If/when this site gets more traffic, I would like to make some graphs of the
data: number of users using each OS, browser, which browsers and OSes have the
highest/lowest success rate, etc. I may make some of the data available as a web
service as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may not be much to look at, but trust me: under the hood, this site rocks.</p>

<br />

<p><i><a id="So_who_is_the_genius_behind_this_site">
So who is the genius behind this site?</a></i></p>

<p>That would be me. My name is Eric, and I live in Chicago, IL, USA, where I am
a Java developer for a large, friendly and very well-run bank. I started out as
a liberal arts guy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. When I
saw that my enginering friends were having a much easier time financially than I
was, I decided to sell my soul to silicon. (It was the 1990s, everybody did it.) I
enrolled at a more expensive yet
less presitigous school near Chicago and got a degree in CS. (So if you can't get
a job because you don't have a degree, call me, I have a spare. Maybe we can work
something out.)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
At first,
technology was something I did to pay the rent. After I got a job at a small company
that used Sun servers, I was hooked on UNIX, and technology became something I
liked to do. I even had an Ultra 5 on my desk.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, I have installed Linux on my PC at home. I only boot into Windows
when I have to call the cable company about a bad connection. I haven't had to
do this for over a year.
